    <h1>Assignment 5b</h1>
    <p class="highlight" style="color: #4a148c;">In this CSS lesson, I learned the difference between external,
        internal, and inline styles and how they can all be used to control the design and layout of a webpage. Using
        external CSS helps keep code clean and reusable. Internal styles are useful for single-page customization, and
        inline styles work well for quick changes. Understanding CSS helped me create visually consistent pages and
        improved my confidence in building websites. I will use these styling techniques to enhance the appearance and
        readability of my future websites, making them more attractive and user-friendly for visitors.</p>
