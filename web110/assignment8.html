    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        In this lesson, I learned how to use basic SQL commands to work with databases. I now understand how to get
        data, filter it, count records, add new information, and update existing data. These commands are useful for web
        development because websites often need to connect to a database to store and show information. Learning these
        skills helps me understand how websites work behind the scenes. I used Grammarly to check my grammar and
        spelling to make sure everything is correct. I also looked over my page to make sure it looks clean and easy to
        read.
