        Doing the Northwind database activities helped me understand how different tables work together in a database. I
        learned about keys that connect tables and how to find information by looking at data in related tables. This
        practice showed me how data is organized in real businesses, like customers, orders, and products. I also got
        better at reading and understanding database information without using special software. This will help me in
        the future when working with databases or creating websites because I will know how to organize and find data
        clearly and correctly.
