        In the “Send, receive, and respond to email” activity, I learned how to compose and send emails using Gmail.
        This included
        writing a message, adding a subject line, attaching files like documents or images, and setting up an email
        signature that appears at the bottom of every message. I also learned how to format text for clarity and
        emphasis, such as bold or bullet points. This activity helped me understand how to communicate more
        professionally and clearly. I will use these skills when submitting assignments or asking questions to
        instructors, and later in the workplace when writing to coworkers or customers.

        For this activity, I reviewed how to use an email client program by setting up Mozilla Thunderbird. I learned
        that Thunderbird is a free, open-source desktop email application that allows users to manage multiple email
        accounts in one place. After reading the setup guides, I successfully configured my Gmail account using IMAP
        settings, which let me send and receive emails directly through the client. I also explored how Thunderbird
        offers advanced features like message organization, spam filtering, and offline access. These tools are useful
        for both academic and professional environments where email management is important. This experience helped me
        better understand how email clients work and how they can improve productivity.

        After completing the TutorialsPoint: Social Networking tutorial, I chose to focus on Facebook as a social media
        platform of interest. I learned that Facebook is designed to help people connect with friends, family, and
        communities by sharing posts, photos, videos, and participating in groups or events. One of the most useful
        features is the ability to follow pages related to jobs, hobbies, or school activities. I also learned how
        privacy settings and content control are important to manage what others can see. I can use Facebook in my
        personal life to stay in touch with people and in my professional life to join industry-related groups, network
        with others, or promote future projects or events.

        In the “Internet Services” tutorial from TutorialsPoint, I learned about several essential services that make up
        the modern Internet, including email, file transfer (FTP), remote login (Telnet), voice over IP (VoIP), and the
        World Wide Web. The tutorial explained how each service works and what role it plays in communication and data
        sharing. I was especially interested in how FTP is used for uploading files to servers, something that can be
        useful for web development. I also better understand how VoIP is changing the way people make phone calls over
        the Internet. This knowledge is helpful not only for academic use, but also in future careers involving IT,
        networking, or online collaboration.
