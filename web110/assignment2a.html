        The first activity I completed was called “Comparing Web Browsers.” In this activity, I looked at different web
        browsers like Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari. I learned that each browser works a little
        differently. For example, Chrome is fast and has many extensions, Firefox is better for privacy, and Safari
        works well on Apple devices. I didn’t know that websites can look or act different depending on the browser. Now
        I understand that as a future web developer, I need to test my websites on more than one browser. This will help
        make sure that all users have the same good experience, no matter which browser they are using. I also learned
        that not everyone uses the same browser, so it’s important to think about different users when creating
        websites.

        The second activity I did was about “Changing Browser Settings.” I practiced clearing my browser history,
        turning on private mode, and adding or removing extensions. I also changed my homepage and learned how to block
        pop-ups. I never really looked at browser settings before, so this was new to me. I learned that these settings
        can help protect my privacy and make my browser faster. In my personal life, I will use these tips to keep my
        browser clean and safe. In the future, I can also help others who don’t know how to manage their browser
        settings. These are useful skills for both everyday life and working in tech.
