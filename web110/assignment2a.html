        The first activity I did was called “Comparing Web Browsers.” I looked at browsers like Google Chrome, Firefox,
        Microsoft Edge, and Opera. I learned that each browser is a bit different. For example, Chrome is fast and has
        many extensions, Firefox is good for privacy, and Opera has useful built-in tools like a free VPN and ad
        blocker. I didn’t know that websites can look or work differently depending on the browser. Now I understand that as a
        future web developer, I should check my websites on different browsers. This way, all users will have a good
        experience no matter what browser they use. I also learned that not everyone uses the same browser, so it is
        important to think about different users when making websites. This activity helped me see why testing on many
        browsers is important for good website design.

        The second activity I did was about “Changing Browser Settings.” I practiced clearing my browser history,
        turning on private mode, and adding or removing extensions. I also changed my homepage and learned how to block
        pop-ups. I never really looked at browser settings before, so this was new to me. I learned that these settings
        can help protect my privacy and make my browser faster. In my personal life, I will use these tips to keep my
        browser clean and safe. In the future, I can also help others who don’t know how to manage their browser
        settings. These are useful skills for both everyday life and working in tech.
