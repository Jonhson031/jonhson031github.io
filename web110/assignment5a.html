    <h1>Assignemt 5A</h1>
    <p>
        In this lesson, I learned how to structure an index page with an unordered list and relative links to other
        assignment pages. I also gained a better understanding of valid HTML structure, including the correct use of
        head, title, body, and paragraph tags. Making sure all links work properly and testing them in the browser
        helped me see how each part connects. I now feel more confident working with relative references and basic
        navigation on a website. This will help me in the future when I build personal or professional web pages that
        need clear and organized site structure.
