        One of the activities I completed was “What is the Internet?” This topic introduced the basic concept of the
        Internet as a global network of interconnected devices that communicate using standardized protocols. I learned
        that the Internet is not a single entity or system, but a collection of independent networks that agree to
        communicate with each other. Understanding this helped clarify the difference between the Internet and the World
        Wide Web, which are often mistakenly used interchangeably. The Internet refers to the infrastructure, while the
        Web is a service that runs on top of it. I can apply this knowledge by being more precise in technical
        discussions and documentation, especially as I pursue web development. It also helps me better understand how
        various online services (like cloud storage or email) function across distributed systems, which is important as
        I consider a future in IT or software development.

        One of the topics I explored was "Git," which is a distributed version control system used to manage and track
        changes in code or files. I learned that Git allows developers to take snapshots of their work, collaborate
        without overwriting each other’s progress, and go back to earlier versions if needed. The concept of version
        control made me realize how important it is to maintain a clean and reliable development history, especially
        when working in teams. I can apply this knowledge directly to my current web development course by using Git to
        organize my code, experiment with new features safely through branches, and submit polished work. In the future,
        as I work on larger software or website projects, Git will help me manage complexity and collaborate more
        effectively with others.
