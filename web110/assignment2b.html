            The first activity I completed was the GCFLearnFree: Search Better tutorial. This activity helped me
            understand how to use search engines more effectively by using specific keywords, Boolean operators, and
            quotation marks. I practiced using exact phrase searches such as "search engine market share" and compared
            the results with and without quotes. I saw that using quotation marks returned more focused and accurate
            results. I also searched for specific content using `site:wikiversity.org`, which returned better results
            than using Wikiversity’s built-in search. I learned how to use Boolean operators like OR to search for
            either “search engine” or “SEO,” which broadened my results. This activity showed me how to be more
            efficient when researching information online. I can apply this skill in the future when gathering sources
            for assignments or researching topics for web development projects.

            The second activity was comparing search engines. I searched the same topic, “web search engine,” on Google,
            Bing, Yahoo, and Ask. I noticed that Google gave the most helpful results and was the easiest to use. Bing
            and Yahoo had some useful links, but their layouts were more crowded. Ask gave fewer results and didn’t look
            as modern. I also searched for “search engine market share” and found that Google has the highest market
            share.
