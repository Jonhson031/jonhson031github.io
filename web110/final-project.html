        During the WEB110 course, I learned the basics of HTML and CSS, which are the building blocks of websites. I
        practiced creating web pages from scratch, styling them with external CSS, and making them look organized and
        user-friendly. I also learned how to fix common coding mistakes and use helpful tools like the W3C Validator.
        These skills gave me confidence to continue learning web development and start building my own websites. I now
        understand how websites are built and styled, and I feel more prepared for future web development courses and
        real-world projects.
