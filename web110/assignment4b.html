        The first activity I completed was about practicing web browser safety using Google Chrome. I started by
        reviewing Chrome’s privacy settings, where I learned how to control cookies, manage site permissions, and block
        trackers. I checked that my browser was up to date and reviewed my extensions to make sure they were all needed
        and safe. I removed old add-ons I wasn’t using and cleared my browser cache, history, and cookies. I also
        visited a secure site (https://en.wikiversity.org) and looked at its certificate to confirm the connection was
        encrypted. One thing I found interesting was using Incognito mode to visit a site that usually remembers me—it
        didn’t recognize me at all, which showed how private browsing hides your history and cookies. This activity
        helped me understand how to better protect my privacy online. I will use these safety steps regularly to protect
        my personal information, especially when using shared or public computers.

        In second activity, I completed tutorials on Internet safety and security from GCFLearnFree and TutorialsPoint. I
        learned about common online threats such as phishing scams, malware, identity theft, and unsafe websites. The
        tutorials emphasized the importance of using strong passwords, keeping software updated, and being cautious when
        clicking links or downloading files. I also learned about the role of firewalls and antivirus software in
        protecting devices from attacks. These lessons reinforced the idea that staying safe online requires constant
        attention and good habits. I plan to apply these concepts by being more careful when browsing, regularly
        updating my security software, and educating others about safe Internet practices. This knowledge is essential
        for both my personal online activities and any future roles where cybersecurity awareness is important.
