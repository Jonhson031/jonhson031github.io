    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>
        In this lesson, I learned why web accessibility is important and how to make websites easier for everyone to
        use,
        including people with disabilities. I used tools like the WAVE Web Accessibility Tool and the W3C Validators to
        check for errors in my website. I learned how to add alt text to images and make sure that text colors have good
        contrast with the background. These changes help users who use screen readers or have trouble seeing. I will use
        these skills in the future to build better websites that are clear, easy to use, and accessible to all visitors.
