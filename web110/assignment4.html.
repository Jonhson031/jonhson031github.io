        In this activity, I learned how to verify physical and network-level Internet connectivity using a variety of
        tools and methods. First, I confirmed the physical connection by checking the status lights on my router and
        network adapter. I then used the `ipconfig` command on Windows to verify that my device had a valid IP address
        and was connected to the network. To test connectivity further, I used the `ping` command to check responses
        from my own device, my default gateway, and an external server (8.8.8.8). I also used `tracert` to trace the
        path data takes to reach an Internet host, which showed how information travels through multiple routers.
        Additionally, I used `nslookup` to check DNS resolution and verify that domain names are translating into
        correct IP addresses. This activity gave me valuable troubleshooting skills that I can use in real-life
        situations when dealing with slow Internet or network failures. These tools will be especially useful in future
        IT support roles or if I manage a home or small office network.

        In this activity, I explored how to check and manage IP address settings on a Windows system using the built-in
        `ipconfig` command. I learned how to view basic IP information, such as my IPv4 address, subnet mask, and
        default gateway. Using `ipconfig /all`, I was able to see more detailed network adapter information, including
        MAC addresses and DHCP settings. I also practiced releasing and renewing the dynamic IP address using `ipconfig
        /release` and `ipconfig /renew`. This helped me understand how dynamic IP addressing works and how to
        troubleshoot common network issues. I can apply this knowledge in real-world situations when I need to solve
        Wi-Fi or connectivity problems at home or in a workplace setting. Knowing how to access and interpret this
        information is a useful technical skill for both IT support and general computer maintenance.
